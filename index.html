            <h1>Javascript Basics</h1>
                <p>
                    Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. it is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Variable Declaration</a> 
                        Javacript variables are containers for storing data values. Imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. 
                    <span>var x;</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Variable Assignment</a>
                        Assignment operators assign values to Javascript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable.
                        <span>var x =10;</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Data Types</a>
                        Data types are an important concept; to be able to 
                        operate on variables you need to know the data type. 
                        There are six data types that are Javascript primitives; 
                        Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false; </span>null
                        <span>- null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> 
                        or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>
                        Array - <span>[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object
                        - <span>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Conditionals</a>
                        When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different
                        decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or Conditionals
                        that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to
                        accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span>
                        a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span>
                        to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else</span>
                        we execute this block of code;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Loops</a>
                        There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, 
                        but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action
                        some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around
                        the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a href="#">Function</a>
                        Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our function
                        this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As
                        an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up 
                        the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the
                        table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished
                        our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our
                        function over and over again. 
                    </li>
